CrazyJavaProgrammer is a java programmer who is very smart but use her knowledge of programming to write funny codes. I hope one day she decide to use her intelligence to write useful codes.

One day this crazyJavaProgrammer fell in love with another smart and diligent java programmer and learned disciplines. And one day "crazyJavaProgrammer" was bored so she decided to play on her computer which eventually became a project with her boyfriend. Then one day the couple created a brilliant program on their computer.

The computer is called "R2-D2." It was a brillient computer figure that can be communicate with human- beings. As time is going on, R2-D2 is stolen by a guy. His name was Darth Vader. He used the computer as his slave.

But R2-D2 really like to play with cute puppies and decides to ruin Darth Vader's evil plans and spends the rest of his life, or as long as his battery lasts, frolicking in the rolling hills, enjoying the sun and petting 378346965873409 cute puppies everyday. He has started to think of himslef as a dog and things are getting weird, but we're happy for R2-D2.
